### Common "Issues"
Don't file these issues, because they are NOT issues.

1. Quest editing doesn't work on servers!
	* I know, it's a design choice and a necesity to make sure editing won't corrupt while saving.
2. After changing minecraft name via mojang site, I'm not part of my party anymore!
 	* Use `/hqm edit oldplayername` to get the questbook of your old player name, you use that to invite your new name to the party you used to be in.
3. 1.8 support?!
 	* Is in the works, but not soon, don't ask for ETA's.
